## How to use the Real.h?
The Real class have four constructos:
1. empty constructor;
2. initialize constructor by two integers  (numerator and denominator respectively);
3. initialize constructor by a float number;

After a Real object is instance, you can you the usual operations to work with it (look the Test_Real.cpp).

For convert the **Real to float/double** number you can call method get.

## Warning
The Real class can simplify the fractions, but this don't happen when you create a instance.
